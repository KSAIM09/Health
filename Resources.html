 			<h1>Covid-19</h1>
 			<p>Fear, anxiety, and stress are common responses to visible or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty or unknown. It is therefore common and understandable that people face fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
            Adding to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic like COVID-19 are major changes in our daily lives as our movements are limited in support of efforts to prevent and slow the spread of the virus. To deal with the new realities of homework, temporary unemployment, home schooling, and the lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we take care of our minds, and our physical health.

 				<h1>MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWS</h1>
 				<p>
 					Motivational interviewing is a counseling method that helps people resolve ambivalent feelings and insecurities to find the internal motivation they need to change their behavior. It is a practical, empathetic, and short-term process that takes into consideration how difficult it is to make life changes.<br><h3>When It's Used</h3><br>
 					Motivational interviewing is often used to address addiction and the management of physical health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. This intervention helps people become motivated to change the behaviors that are preventing them from making healthier choices. It can also prepare individuals for further, more specific types of therapies. Research has shown that this intervention works well with individuals who start off unmotivated or unprepared for change. It is less useful for those who are already motivated to change. Motivational interviewing is also appropriate for people who are angry or hostile. They may not be ready to commit to change, but motivational interviewing can help them move through the emotional stages of change necessary to find their motivation.

 				<h1>CURATED VIDEOS</h1>
 				<p>Video curation refers to the art of finding the best videos on a topic, compiling them, and sharing your findings with others. A video curator spends hours finding the best of the best from the plethora of videos out there and shares it with his/her audience.
                Since a majority of people out there don’t have the time or the resources to create original videos every day, video curation makes sure that there’s always something to share!</p>
